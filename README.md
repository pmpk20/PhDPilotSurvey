PhDPilotSurvey

I'm treating this file as a working log to accompany the PilotAnalysis.R script

03/02:
- Setting up the dataset to combine respondent information in Pilot, and information about the DCE in SpecificChoices

04/02:
- Tried to coerce DCE into MLOGIT data. It worked but models didn't.
- Translated R to Python in Pylot.py
- Listed possible models to estimate.

05/02:
- Used the APOLLO package to estimate one MNL and works but questionably
- Estimated some Probit and LM models
- Defined a function to graph results
