PhDPilotSurvey

To-Do:
- Finish PYLOGIT attempt in Python and estimate MXL/NL
- More changes to APOLLO code in R
- Estimate other models
- Report

Updates:
10/02:
- Python: tried different packages and PYLOGIT looks promising so far but not finished.
- R: Trying to change the APOLLO MNL example to be more realistic with limited progress- at least it doesn't say infinite standard errors anymore.
