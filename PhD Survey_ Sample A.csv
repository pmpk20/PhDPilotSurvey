I was expect a choice scenario which was equivalent to the research question.  why didn't you do that?

Remember that students (eg) don't pay income tax.  if you talk about increasing a tax some people dont pay, those people won't mind any increase.  Maybe say ""your overall tax burden"" or just ""tax"".

in the question asking about peoples confidence that firms would take note of this survey, add a sentence clarifying that the results of this survey will be made available to firms producing products affected.  Otherwise people may think, ""meh, firms probably wont even see this, so I'm sure they won't take any account of it"".

I really think you need a map of the UK with distances shown (to the coast).  I'll make one for you if you buy me a box of posh biscuits.  Which you owe me anyway (cough, Asimov).

Wording in a couple of places still has grammar typos.  Also, you can make the donations to charities wording clearer.
